Command "encrypt"

This command will look for unencrypted values in all local configurations and updates them by encrypting them.
- The encrypted values are properties that begin with '#' and contain string.
- For example {"#someSecretProperty": "secret value"} will be transformed into {"#someSecretProperty": "KBC::ComponentSecure::<encryptedcontent>"}

You can use the "--dry-run" flag to see
what needs to be done without modifying the files.

Usage:
  %s encrypt [flags]

Flags:
      --dry-run   print what needs to be done

Global Flags:
%A
