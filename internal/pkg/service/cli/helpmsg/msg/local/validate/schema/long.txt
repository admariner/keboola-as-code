Command "local validate schema"

Validate the content of the specifiedJSON file
against the specified JSON schema file.

The JSON schema should contain a schema for the parameters key,
just like the configuration/row schema in a component definition.

The main purpose of this command is to test a new JSON schema
before it is changed in a component definition. It can be used
both in a project local directory and also separately.
