Command "create config"

Creates a new config in the local directory structure.
A new unique ID is assigned to the new object (there is no need to call "persist").
To save the new object to the project, call "push" after the "create".

You will be prompted for name, branch and component ID.
You can also specify them using flags or environment.

Tip:
  You can also create a new config by copying
  an existing one and running the "persist" command.
