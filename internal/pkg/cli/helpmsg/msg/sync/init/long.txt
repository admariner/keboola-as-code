Command "sync init"

Initialize local project's directory
and make first sync from the Keboola Connection.

You will be prompted to define:
- storage API host
- storage API token of your project
- allowed branches
- GitHub Actions workflows

You can also enter these values
by flags or environment variables.

This CLI tool will only work with the specified "allowed branches".
Others will be ignored, although they will still exist in the project.
