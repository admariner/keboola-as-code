Command "create config"

Creates a new config in the local directory structure.
A new unique ID is assigned to the new object (there is no need to call "persist").
To save the new object to the project, call "push" after "create".

You will be prompted for the object specification,
or you can enter it using flags / ENVs.

Tip:
  You can also create a new config by copying
  an existing one and running the "persist" command.

Usage:
  %s create config [flags]

Flags:
  -b, --branch string         branch ID or name
  -c, --component-id string   component ID
  -n, --name string           name of the new config

Global Flags:
%A
