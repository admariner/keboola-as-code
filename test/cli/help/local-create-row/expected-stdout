Command "local create row"

Creates a new config row in the local directory structure.
A new unique ID is assigned to the new object (there is no need to call "persist").
To save the new object to the project, call "push" after the "create".

You will be prompted for name, branch and config.
You can also specify them using flags or environment.

Tip:
  You can also create a new config row by copying
  an existing one and running the "persist" command.

Usage:
  %s create row [flags]

Flags:
  -b, --branch string   branch ID or name
  -c, --config string   config name or ID
  -n, --name string     name of the new config row
