### Command "create branch"

- Creates a new dev branch in the project remote state.
- The new branch will be a copy of the current remote state of the main branch.
- It is recommended to first "push" local changes in the main branch if any.
- When the branch is created, the new state is pulled to the local directory.


### Command "create config/row"

Creates a new config or config row in the local directory structure.
A new unique ID is assigned to the new object (there is no need to call "persist").

You will be prompted for all needed values.
You can also specify them using flags or environment.

Tip:
  You can also create a new config or config row by copying
  an existing one and running the "persist" command.
