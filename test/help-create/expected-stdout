### Command "create branch"

- Creates a new dev branch in the project remote state.
- Local changes have no effect, so it is recommended to first use the "push" command.
- When the branch is created, the new state is pulled to the local directory.


### Command "create config/row"

Creates a new config or config row in the local directory structure.
A new unique ID is assigned to the new object (there is no need to call "persist").
To save the new object to the project, call "push" after the "create".

You will be prompted for all needed values.
You can also specify them using flags or environment.

Tip:
  You can also create a new config or config row by copying
  an existing one and running the "persist" command.

  %s create [command]

  branch      Create branch
