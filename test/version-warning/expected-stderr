Warning: Your project needs to be migrated to the new version of the Keboola CLI.
  1. Make sure you have a backup of the current project directory (eg. git commit, git push).
  2. Then run "kbc pull --force" to overwrite local state.
  3. Manually check that there are no unexpected changes in the project directory (git diff).
